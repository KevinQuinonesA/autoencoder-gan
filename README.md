# Autoencoder GAN
We introduce effective training algorithms for GenerativeAdversarial Networks (GAN) to alleviate mode collapse and gradient vanishing. In our system, we constrain the generator by an Autoencoder (AE). We propose a formulation to consider the reconstructed samples from AE as “real” samples for the discriminator.

This is a college project based on previous implemtneations. Wht we did here was used fine tuning to improve the performance of our AGAN
